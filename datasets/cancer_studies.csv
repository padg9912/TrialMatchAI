Early detection and treatment of cervical lesions and standardized management have emerged as essential pillars in the Global Cervical Cancer Elimination. The loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) is widely employed as a preferred approach for the diagnosis and treatment of precancerous cervical lesions and early invasive cervical cancer. Patients with high-grade cervical lesions are more prone to experiencing sexual dysfunction and psychological disorders after LEEP, attributed to the unique surgical site, physiological alterations, and psychological stress during the postoperative recovery process, thereby adversely affecting their quality of life. Currently, there is a shortage of research evidence regarding targeted intervention measures and long-term effect evaluations for sexual function quality and quality of life after LEEP for cervical lesions. In recent years, the health management model based on patient navigation has evolved into a novel modality for facilitating comprehensive tumor prevention and control.

NCT02786199,Histological Differentiation Grade Predicted by Ultrasound Backscatterer Imaging,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02786199,UNKNOWN,"Histological grade of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an important prognostic factor affecting patient survival. It has been divided into four grades from I to IV on the basis of histological differentiation. Grade I is the best differentiated consisting of small tumor cells arranged in thin trabeculae. Cells with higher grade are larger and less differentiated with hyperchromatic nuclei and loss of trabecular pattern.

Ultrasound is an imaging modality frequently used to evaluate liver tumors because of its convenience, real-time, less expensive and no radiation exposure. However, ultrasonographic evaluation by conventional B-mode image is semi quantitative and subjective. It still cannot replace liver biopsy for the evaluation of HCC.

This study is aimed to quantify the image characters of B-mode image and the scatterer properties using Nakagami distribution. Nakagami parameter is a general model to describe the distribution of scatterers. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that Nakagami parameter may also reflect the histological changes in different grades of HCC.

In this study, the resected HCC tumor samples will be collected from the participants who are going to receive surgical resection, and the tumor US images and Nakagami values will be obtained via the single-element ultrasound system.

For many pediatric solid tumors, complete resection of the primary site and/or metastatic deposits is critical for achieving a cure. An optimal intra-operative tool to help visualize tumor and its margins would be of benefit. ICG real-time fluorescence imaging is a technique being used increasingly in adults for this purpose. We propose to use it during surgery for pediatric malignancies. All patients with tumors that require localization for resection or biopsy of the tumor and/or metastatic lesions will be eligible.

Primary Objective

To assess the feasibility of Indocyanine Green (ICG)-mediated near-infrared (NIR) imagery to identify neoplastic disease during the conduct of surgery to resect neoplastic lesions in children and adolescents. NIR imaging will be done at the start of surgery to assess NIR-positivity of the lesion(s) and at the end of surgery to assess completeness of resection. Separate assessments will be made for the following different histologic categories:

1. Osteosarcoma
2. Ewing Sarcoma
3. Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS)
4. Non-Rhabdomyosarcoma Soft Tissue Sarcoma (NRSTS)
5. Neuroblastoma
6. Renal tumors (Only bilateral Wilms Tumor patients will be included.)
7. Metastatic pulmonary deposits
8. Liver tumors, lymphoma, other rare tumors, and nodules of unknown etiology

Exploratory Objectives

1. To compare the ICG uptake by primary vs metastatic site and pre-treated (chemotherapy, radiation, or both) vs non-pre-treated.
2. Assess the sensitivity and specificity of NIR imagery to find additional lesions not identified by standard of care intraoperative inspection and tactile feedback.

NCT06030817,99mTc-CNDG Injection in the Diagnosis of Malignant Tumors,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06030817,RECRUITING,"Currently, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) is the most widely used tumor imaging agent in clinical practice. However, the production of 18F requires accelerators and is associated with relatively high diagnostic costs, which to some extent limits its widespread clinical application. In comparison to Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) devices are more abundant and offer lower diagnostic expenses. With the utilization of Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) crystals in SPECT and advancements in image reconstruction techniques, the resolution and sensitivity of SPECT is continually improving. Therefore, the development of a simplified and cost-effective novel SPECT tumor imaging agent holds significant practical significance. This study involved the design and synthesis of a glucose-derived ligand with a linker containing seven methylene units and an isonitrile group (CN7DG).

NCT03160599,Restricted Calorie Ketogenic Diet as a Treatment in Malignant Tumors,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03160599,UNKNOWN,"Malignant tumor incidence showed an upgrade trend in recent years. Standard therapy for malignant tumor includes surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy. Despite optimal treatment the prognosis remains poor. There is an urgent need for more effective therapies. The Warburg effect has been widely observed in human cancers. The main energy supply of tumor cells are aerobic glycolysis. Therefore, they are highly dependent on glucose metabolism. Recently, some scholars have suggested that 'Restricted calorie Ketogenic Diet (RKD)' might be able to inhibit glycolysis and thus anti-tumor by restricting carbohydrate intake. This will 'starve' cancer cells, which will lead to cell death. There are many animal and in vitro studies shown that RKD can reduce the tumor size and thus tumor cell growth of malignant tumors. However, a consistent positive result can not be found within a small sample of clinical trials. In this study, 40 patients with malignant tumors will be treated with or without RKD. The safety and efficacy of RKD and the patients' tolerance will be observed in order to understand whether this therapy can be a potential new treatment This clinical study is comparatively large internationally.

Decitabine (DAC), one major DNA demethylating agent, has been approved for treatment of preleukemic hematological disease myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) by the Food and Drug Administration. Past trials of these with high doses, i.e., the use of maximal tolerated dose, for patients with solid tumors showed a low therapeutic index, due to extreme toxicities that have probably confounded the ability to document the true clinical response.

Low dose DNA demethylation agent decitabine (DAC) can resensitize the therapeutic indexes of resistent ovary cancer cells in vivo and in vitro.

The investigators hypothesized that DAC-triggered epigenetic reprogramming of tumor cells and possible immune cells could induce pronounced long-dated clinical effect by chemosensitization- and immunopotentiation-driven maximal eradicating roles on the minimal/residual lesions in primary patients with poor prognosis.",NO,Primary Malignant Neoplasm of Ovary|FIGO Stages II to IV,DRUG: Decitabine (DTC Arm)|DRUG: Paclitaxel and Carboplatin (TC Arm),"Progression-free survival in DTC treated advanced ovary cancer, The primary endpoint of this trial was progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of the first occurrence of any of the following events: appearance of any new lesions that could be measured or assessed clinically; or CA125 criteria of disease progression.

It works by using high-intensity ultrasound waves to create microscopic bubbles within the tumour tissue. These bubbles rapidly expand and collapse, generating shock waves that disrupt the tissue. The technique is highly precise and can be targeted to specific areas of the liver, allowing for selective destruction of tumour cells while minimizing damage to healthy tissue. This study will enrol 20 patients with liver tumours (be it primary or secondary liver tumours), monitor their post-operative adverse events, and study the changes in tumour size and volume after treatment. Histotripsy will be performed under general anaesthesia, with real-time monitoring by ultrasound, and deliver high-intensity ultrasound waves in single session or multiple sessions. Similar to other minimal invasive treatments, patients will be admitted 1 day prior, then receive Histotripsy on the next day and stay overnight for observation.
